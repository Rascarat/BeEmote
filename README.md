# BeEmote

To get started, make a copy of the Example files in the BeEmote.Services project, in the Security folder.
Then rename them so that you end up with the following.

- Example.ConnectionStrings.cs
- Example.Credentials.cs
- ConnectionStrings.cs
- Credentials.cs

Remove ".Example" from the namespace and replace the Snake_case_example_strings with proper values.
Do this for the following files:

- ConnectionStrings.cs
- Credentials.cs

Should be good to go now.
